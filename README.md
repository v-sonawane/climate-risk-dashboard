🧠 Project: Climate Risk Intelligence – AI-Powered Climate Risk Intelligence for Insurance
🌪️ Real-Time Climate-Aware Underwriting. For All Lines of Insurance.
🎯 Problem
Climate volatility, evolving ESG mandates, and shifting regulatory landscapes are rapidly reshaping insurance underwriting. Traditional tools are:

Reactive, not proactive

Siloed by region or product line

Manual, lacking AI-driven insights

Insurers need a unified way to assess risk across all lines of business—with climate and ESG built in.

💡 Solution: ClimateIQ
A next-generation climate-aware underwriting dashboard, designed to support all 5 core insurance verticals:

🔹 1. Property
Track fire, flood, and storm hazards that drive catastrophic loss modeling.

🔹 2. Casualty
Understand liability shifts linked to ESG regulations and supply chain events.

🔹 3. Life
Monitor temperature, drought, and long-term climate trends impacting actuarial models.

🔹 4. Health
Track urban heat islands, air quality, and hazard hotspots affecting population risk.

🔹 5. Reinsurance
Provide reinsurers with AI-generated, evidence-backed summaries of aggregate risk and ESG exposure by region and domain.
